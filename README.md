# Detection of Virus Attack using HPCs  

This project focuses on detecting virus attacks by analyzing changes in Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). Key metrics such as **task clock, context switches, CPU migrations, page faults, cycles, instructions, branches, and branch misses** are monitored to identify unusual patterns indicative of malicious activity. By leveraging these low-level hardware indicators, the system aims to provide an efficient and lightweight method for malware detection.  

The repository includes scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning models to classify normal and anomalous behavior based on HPC variations.
